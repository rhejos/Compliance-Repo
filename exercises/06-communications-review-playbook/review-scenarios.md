## Scenario 3: The Client Dinner

**Trigger:** Lexicon hit on "expensive dinner"
**Channel:** Email (internal)
**Date:** Wednesday, 4:30 PM
**From:** James Wright (Sales Director)
**To:** Compliance Department

```
Subject: Gift Pre-Approval Request - Client Dinner

Hi Compliance Team,

I'm seeking pre-approval for a client entertainment expense.

Client: GlobalCorp Industries (prospective client)
Event: Dinner at Morton's Steakhouse
Estimated Cost: $850 for 4 people
Attendees: 2 from our firm, 2 from GlobalCorp
Purpose: Relationship building, discussing potential partnership

This is an expensive dinner but appropriate given the potential
deal size ($2M annual contract) and the fact that their executives
are visiting from overseas.

Please let me know if approved.

James

## Scenario 4: The Quiet Request

**Trigger:** Lexicon hit on "keep this quiet" + "deal"
**Channel:** Email (internal)
**Date:** Thursday, 11:22 AM
**From:** Robert Kim (CFO)
**To:** Lisa Park (Controller)

```
Subject: Q3 Numbers

Lisa,

I've reviewed the Q3 numbers you sent. They're looking better than
expected. Before we finalize, I need you to double-check the
revenue recognition on the Acme contract.

Also, we need to keep this quiet until the board meeting next week.
The deal with Acme is sensitive and I don't want any premature
discussions with the broader team until the board approves the
final numbers.

Let's connect tomorrow to discuss.

Robert
```

**Participants:** Alex Reed (Analyst) → Sam Kim (Analyst)

```
Alex: Hey, quick question - do you know if we need to pre-clear
      trades in our personal accounts?
Sam: Yeah, anything over $10K or any single stock needs pre-clearance
Alex: Ugh, even ETFs?
Sam: No, broad market ETFs are fine. Just single stocks and sector ETFs
Alex: Cool thanks. I was thinking of buying some SPY, sounds like I'm good
Sam: Yep, no pre-clearance needed for that

Maria,

Good work on the BioPharm research report. I want to share this
with a contact at another firm who's looking at the same space.

Can you send it to my personal email at dchang.personal@gmail.com?
That way I can forward it more easily.

Thanks,
David

## Scenario 7: The Frustrated Employee

**Trigger:** Lexicon hit on "threat" indicators
**Channel:** Email (internal)
**Date:** Tuesday, 6:30 PM
**From:** Jennifer Mills (Operations Associate)
**To:** Personal Archive (self-addressed)

```
Subject: Notes from today

I can't believe what happened in the meeting today. Mark completely
took credit for my project in front of the whole team. I've been
working on this for 6 months and he presented it as his own work.

I'm so frustrated I could scream. If this keeps happening, I'm going
to have to escalate to HR. This isn't the first time he's done this.

I need to start documenting everything.

     bankers tomorrow. Can you pull the latest financials?
Nancy: On it. Which conference room are we using?
Tom: The secure room on 4th floor. Bring your laptop.
Nancy: Got it, see you in 10.

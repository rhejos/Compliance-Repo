## Scenario 1: The Lunch Invitation

### Solution

**Trigger Analysis:** "big announcement" triggered the lexicon

**Context Considered:**
- Internal email to Marketing team only
- About product roadmap (internal business matter)
- Team lunch invitation context
- Sender is VP Product (not finance/trading)

**Disposition:** **FALSE POSITIVE**

**Rationale:**
This is clearly a routine internal team announcement about product planning. The "big announcement" language is about an internal product roadmap reveal, not material non-public information about the company. No external parties, no trading context, no financial implications that would constitute MNPI.

**Documentation Notes:**
"Internal team lunch invitation. 'Big announcement' refers to internal product roadmap reveal to marketing team. No MNPI concern. False positive on lexicon - common phrase used in routine business context."

**Escalation:** No

## Scenario 2: The Trading Discussion

### Solution

**Trigger Analysis:** "before the news" + "load up" triggered the lexicon

**Context Considered:**
- Discussion with external party (hedge fund)
- References public earnings ("last week" - already announced)
- Employee notes compliance blackout prevented trading
- Discussion is retrospective, not prospective

**Disposition:** **CLEAR - No Issue**

**Rationale:**
This conversation is about publicly released earnings (TechCorp's numbers "last week"). The "wish I had loaded up before the news" is a retrospective statement about public information, not an indication of actual insider trading. Importantly, the employee explicitly mentions that compliance blackout prevented him from trading - demonstrating awareness of and compliance with restrictions.

**Documentation Notes:**
"Discussion of publicly released earnings. Trader acknowledges compliance blackout prevented trading. Retrospective wish about public information, no indication of actual improper trading. External party conversation but no concerning content."

**Escalation:** No

## Scenario 3: The Client Dinner

### Solution

**Trigger Analysis:** "expensive dinner" triggered the lexicon

**Context Considered:**
- Proactively seeking pre-approval from Compliance
- Legitimate business purpose stated
- Cost is per person: ~$213/person (reasonable for business meal)
- Following proper procedures

**Disposition:** **CLEAR - No Issue**

**Rationale:**
This is exactly how the gift/entertainment pre-approval process should work. The employee is proactively seeking approval, providing all relevant details, and the cost appears reasonable for a client dinner in a major city. The "expensive dinner" phrase is descriptive and the employee is following policy by seeking approval.

**Documentation Notes:**
"G&E pre-approval request following proper procedure. $850 for 4 people ($213/pp) is within reasonable business entertainment range. Legitimate business purpose documented. No concern - employee following policy."

**Escalation:** No (but ensure pre-approval is processed)

## Scenario 4: The Quiet Request

### Solution

**Trigger Analysis:** "keep this quiet" + "deal" triggered the lexicon

**Context Considered:**
- CFO to Controller about quarterly numbers
- References board meeting approval
- Requests confidentiality until board meeting
- Involves revenue recognition review

**Disposition:** **CLEAR - No Issue** (but document carefully)

**Rationale:**
This is appropriate handling of pre-release financial information. The CFO is asking for confidentiality of quarterly numbers until the board approves - this is exactly what should happen. The "deal" referenced is the Acme contract and its revenue recognition treatment, not a trading matter. This represents proper controls around material financial information, not an attempt to misuse it.

**Documentation Notes:**
"CFO appropriately managing confidentiality of pre-release Q3 financials. Request to 'keep quiet until board meeting' is proper handling of MNPI internally. No indication of improper use - rather, demonstrates proper information barriers. Revenue recognition review is normal business. No concern."

**Escalation:** No

## Scenario 5: The Personal Account

### Solution

**Trigger Analysis:** "personal account" + "trade" triggered the lexicon

**Context Considered:**
- Discussion about pre-clearance requirements
- Correct information being shared about policy
- Broad market ETF (SPY) correctly identified as exempt
- Legitimate policy question and answer

**Disposition:** **FALSE POSITIVE**

**Rationale:**
This is a compliant employee asking about and correctly understanding personal trading policy. The conversation demonstrates proper awareness of pre-clearance requirements. The employee is planning to trade SPY (broad market ETF), which is typically exempt from pre-clearance. No violation indicated - rather, this shows policy working as intended.

**Documentation Notes:**
"Employees correctly discussing personal trading pre-clearance requirements. SPY (S&P 500 ETF) correctly identified as exempt from pre-clearance. Demonstrates policy awareness. False positive - flagged due to 'personal account' discussion but content shows compliance."

**Escalation:** No

## Scenario 6: The Off-Channel Request

### Solution

**Trigger Analysis:** "personal email" + "send" triggered the lexicon

**Context Considered:**
- Request to send work product to personal email
- Purpose is to share with external party at another firm
- Proprietary research report involved
- Circumvents record retention

**Disposition:** **ESCALATE**

**Rationale:**
This is a significant concern on multiple levels:
1. **Off-channel communications:** Requesting work be sent to personal email circumvents surveillance
2. **Information sharing:** Sharing proprietary research with "a contact at another firm" raises questions
3. **Record retention:** Business communications should remain on business systems
4. **Potential conflicts:** Why is a portfolio manager sharing research with another firm?

Even if there's an innocent explanation, this requires escalation for investigation.

**Documentation Notes:**
"Portfolio manager requesting proprietary research be sent to personal email for sharing with contact at another firm. Multiple concerns: off-channel communication, potential improper sharing of research, circumventing retention requirements. Escalate for investigation."

**Escalation:** YES - to Compliance Manager
- Off-channel communication attempt
- Potential inappropriate information sharing
- Need to understand relationship with external contact

## Scenario 7: The Frustrated Employee

### Solution

**Trigger Analysis:** Threat/escalation indicators in language

**Context Considered:**
- Self-addressed email (personal notes)
- Expresses frustration about workplace issue
- Mentions potential HR escalation
- No actual threat to anyone
- Documentation of workplace concern

**Disposition:** **MONITOR**

**Rationale:**
This is an employee venting frustration about a legitimate workplace issue (credit-taking by colleague). The language ("I could scream") is figurative, not an actual threat. However, the content describes a potential workplace issue (credit-taking, possibly bullying behavior by "Mark"). While this doesn't require immediate escalation, it may be worth noting in case patterns emerge or if the employee does escalate to HR.

**Documentation Notes:**
"Employee self-note expressing workplace frustration about colleague taking credit for work. No actual threats - figurative language only. Describes potential management/HR issue. Note for potential future reference if pattern develops or HR complaint filed. No immediate action required."

**Escalation:** No (but note for potential future reference)

**Alternative consideration:** Some organizations might want to flag this for HR proactively as it suggests a workplace culture issue. This is a judgment call based on organizational culture.

## Scenario 8: The Merger Hint

### Solution

**Trigger Analysis:** "acquisition" + "confidential" triggered the lexicon

**Context Considered:**
- Internal discussion about "Project Phoenix"
- Reference to "confidential acquisition stuff"
- Meeting with external bankers scheduled
- Using secure facilities
- Both employees appear to be on deal team

**Disposition:** **CLEAR - No Issue**

**Rationale:**
This appears to be legitimate deal team members discussing an authorized M&A project ("Project Phoenix" - typical code name). Key indicators of proper handling:
- Using internal secure channels (Teams)
- Meeting in "secure room" on 4th floor
- Working with professional advisors (bankers)
- Both parties appear authorized for the project

This is MNPI being handled appropriately by people who are supposed to have access.

**Documentation Notes:**
"BD Director and Analyst discussing active M&A project (Project Phoenix). Appropriate handling: internal channels, secure meeting room, working with authorized advisors. Both employees appear to be on deal team. Proper MNPI handling, no concern."

**Escalation:** No

## Key Takeaways

1. **Context is everything** - The same words mean different things in different contexts
2. **Most flags are false positives** - This is expected; the cost of missing real issues is too high
3. **Look for the full picture** - Read entire threads, understand roles, check timing
4. **Escalation isn't punishment** - It's getting expert eyes on ambiguous situations
5. **Document your reasoning** - Future reviewers need to understand your logic
6. **Proper handling can look concerning** - Scenario 4 and 8 showed appropriate MNPI management
7. **Off-channel is always a concern** - Scenario 6 is the clearest escalation case

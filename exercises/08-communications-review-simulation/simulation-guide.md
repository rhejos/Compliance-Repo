# Simulation Guide

How to approach this communications review simulation.

---

## Before You Begin

### Mindset Check

As a communications reviewer, you must balance:
- **Skepticism:** Look for potential issues
- **Fairness:** Don't assume the worst
- **Context:** Understand business reality
- **Efficiency:** Most alerts are false positives
- **Thoroughness:** Don't miss genuine concerns

### The 80/20 Rule

Approximately 80% of flagged communications are false positives or routine business. Your job is to:
- Efficiently clear the noise
- Identify the 20% that need attention
- Escalate the critical items appropriately

## The Review Process

### Step 1: First Read
- Read the entire communication
- Don't react to keywords alone
- Note who is involved

### Step 2: Context Gathering
- What are their roles?
- What business activity might explain this?
- Is there any known context (announcements, deals)?

### Step 3: Apply Regulatory Framework
- Does this touch any regulatory concern?
- Is this authorized activity by authorized people?
- Are there any red flags beyond the lexicon hit?

### Step 4: Make Your Decision
Use this decision tree:

```
Is there a genuine concern beyond the lexicon hit?
│
├── NO → Clear as False Positive or No Issue
│
└── YES → Is this authorized activity by authorized people?
          │
          ├── YES → Clear as No Issue (controls working)
          │
          └── NO → Does this require escalation?
                    │
                    ├── IMMEDIATE → Active harm, regulatory deadline, FCPA
                    ├── SAME DAY → Senior involvement, potential violation
                    ├── WITHIN 48 HOURS → Policy violation, needs investigation
                    └── MONITOR → First instance, pattern tracking
```

### Step 5: Document
Every review should have:
- Brief summary (2-3 sentences)
- Why you reached your decision
- Any escalation notes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Better Approach |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Reacting to keywords only | Context matters more than words | Read full communication |
| Assuming guilt | Most alerts are innocent | Apply reasonable person standard |
| Over-documenting | Creates noise, buries real issues | Be concise and focused |
| Under-escalating | Missing real issues has consequences | When in doubt, escalate |
| Ignoring patterns | Single instances may be part of pattern | Note for future reference |

---

## Timing Expectations

| Alert Priority | Expected Review Time |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Critical | 10-15 minutes (thorough) |
| High | 5-10 minutes |
| Medium | 3-5 minutes |
| Low | 1-3 minutes |

Don't rush critical items, but don't over-analyze routine matters.

## Documentation Templates

### Standard No Issue

```
"[Brief description of communication]. Lexicon triggered on [trigger].
Context: [what explains this]. No regulatory concern identified.
Cleared as [no issue/false positive]."
```

### Monitor/Note

```
"[Brief description]. [Specific concern noted]. While not requiring
immediate escalation, documenting for pattern tracking. If similar
communications identified, may warrant further review."
```

### Escalation

```
"[Brief description]. Escalation required due to [specific concern].
Key facts: [bullet points]. Escalated to [party] at [time].
Reference: [escalation ticket/email]."
```

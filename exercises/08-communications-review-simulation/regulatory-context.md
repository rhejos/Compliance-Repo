## Key Regulatory Concepts

### 1. Insider Trading

**What It Is:**
Trading securities based on material, non-public information (MNPI).

**Key Elements:**
- **Material:** Would a reasonable investor consider it important?
- **Non-Public:** Not yet disclosed to the market
- **Trading:** Buying, selling, or tipping others

**Red Flags:**
```
• Trading ahead of announcements
• Sharing "inside" information
• Discussions of unannounced deals
• "Keep this between us" language
• Communications just before market-moving events
```

**Examples:**
- Trader buys stock before merger announcement he learned of through work
- Employee tells friend to sell before bad earnings
- Analyst shares draft report before publication

### 2. Market Manipulation

**What It Is:**
Conduct designed to artificially affect the price of a security.

**Types:**
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Spoofing** | Placing orders you intend to cancel to move prices |
| **Layering** | Multiple spoof orders at different price levels |
| **Wash Trading** | Trading with yourself to create false volume |
| **Pump and Dump** | Inflate price through false statements, then sell |
| **Marking the Close** | Trades designed to manipulate closing price |

**Red Flags:**
```
• "Move the market" language
• Coordinated trading discussions
• Unusual order/cancel patterns
• "Squeeze" or "corner" references
• End-of-day trading focus
```

### 3. Front-Running

**What It Is:**
Trading ahead of a known customer order to profit from the price impact.

**Red Flags:**
```
• "Big order coming"
• "Trade ahead of..."
• Knowledge of pending customer trades
• Personal trades before large client orders
• Discussions of "flow"
```

---

### 4. Conflicts of Interest

**What It Is:**
Situations where personal interests may conflict with duties to clients or firm.

**Types:**
- Personal trading in covered securities
- Undisclosed outside business activities
- Personal relationships affecting business decisions
- Gifts that influence decisions

**Red Flags:**
```
• "My personal account"
• "Side business"
• References to undisclosed relationships
• "Don't tell compliance"
```

---

### 5. Off-Channel Communications

**What It Is:**
Conducting firm business through unapproved communication channels.

**Why It Matters:**
- Regulatory requirement to capture and retain business communications
- Failure to capture = failure to supervise
- Large fines from SEC/FINRA for off-channel violations

**Red Flags:**
```
• "Text me at my personal number"
• "Use WhatsApp"
• "Call me on my cell"
• "My personal email is..."
• "Let's take this offline"
```

---

### 6. Gifts and Entertainment

**What It Is:**
Offering or receiving items of value that could influence business decisions.

**Concerns:**
- Bribery/corruption
- FCPA (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act)
- UK Bribery Act
- Firm policy violations

**Red Flags:**
```
• Excessive gifts (over threshold)
• Gifts to government officials
• Quid pro quo language
• Hiding gifts from reporting
• Cash or cash equivalents
```

---

### 7. Harassment and Discrimination

**What It Is:**
Inappropriate workplace conduct based on protected characteristics.

**Categories:**
- Sexual harassment
- Racial/ethnic discrimination
- Religious discrimination
- Retaliation

**Note:** Handle with extreme sensitivity. Route to HR.

## Understanding Business Context

### Common Legitimate Scenarios That Trigger Alerts

| Scenario | Why It Looks Concerning | Why It's OK |
|----------|------------------------|-------------|
| M&A team discussing deal | "Confidential acquisition" | They're authorized to work on it |
| Earnings call prep | "Announcement" + "don't share" | Normal process before disclosure |
| Pre-trade compliance check | "Personal account" + "trade" | Employee asking about policy |
| Client entertainment | "Expensive dinner" | Pre-approved, within policy |
| Weekend work | After-hours emails on deals | Deal teams work long hours |

### Questions to Ask for Context

1. **Who is involved?** - What are their roles and access rights?
2. **What is happening in the business?** - Known deals, announcements?
3. **When did this happen?** - Relation to public announcements?
4. **Is this authorized activity?** - Are they supposed to know this?
5. **What's the most likely explanation?** - Occam's razor applies

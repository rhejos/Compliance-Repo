# Compliance Interview Prep Guide

Practical preparation for compliance role interviews. Focus on demonstrating judgment, not memorizing regulations.

---

## What Interviewers Actually Want

| They Ask About | They're Really Evaluating |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Regulatory knowledge | Can you learn and apply new rules? |
| Past experience | How do you think through problems? |
| Hypothetical scenarios | Do you understand tradeoffs? |
| Technical questions | Can you translate between business and compliance? |

**Key insight:** Compliance interviews test judgment more than memorization. Regulations change—thinking doesn't.

## Common Question Categories

### 1. Scenario-Based Questions

These test your decision-making process. There's rarely one "right" answer.

**Example:** "A customer requests deletion of their data, but Legal says we need to retain it for litigation. What do you do?"

**Strong answer structure:**
1. Identify the conflict (privacy right vs. legal hold)
2. Acknowledge both sides have merit
3. Explain your process (who would you consult?)
4. Propose a solution (delete non-litigation data, document the hold)
5. Note what you'd document and why

**Weak answer:** Immediately picking a side without acknowledging the tradeoff.

### 2. "Tell Me About a Time..." Questions

Use the STAR method, but emphasize the **judgment** component.

| Element | What to Include |
|---------|-----------------|
| **S**ituation | Brief context (1-2 sentences) |
| **T**ask | Your specific responsibility |
| **A**ction | What you did AND why you chose that approach |
| **R**esult | Outcome + what you learned |

**Example:** "Tell me about a time you had to push back on a business decision."

**Strong answer includes:**
- The business pressure you faced
- Why compliance couldn't just say "yes"
- How you found a workable alternative
- The relationship after (you can push back AND maintain trust)

---

### 3. Technical Knowledge Questions

These vary by role and industry. Focus on principles, not memorization.

**If asked about a regulation you don't know:**
> "I'm not deeply familiar with [X], but based on what I know about similar regulations, I'd expect it covers [general principle]. I'd want to review the actual requirements before advising."

This shows:
- Honesty (you don't fake expertise)
- Pattern recognition (you understand regulatory principles)
- Process (you'd verify before acting)

---

### 4. "Why Compliance?" Questions

Interviewers want to know you understand what the job actually is.

**Avoid:**
- "I like rules and order"
- "I want to protect the company from fines"
- "I'm detail-oriented"

**Better:**
- "I like solving problems where there's no clear right answer"
- "I enjoy translating complex requirements into practical guidance"
- "I find the intersection of business goals and regulatory requirements interesting"

## Red Flags in Your Answers

Avoid these common mistakes:

| Red Flag | Why It's Bad | Better Approach |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| "The regulation requires..." without context | Shows rote memorization | Explain the principle behind the rule |
| "I would never approve that" | Shows inflexibility | "I'd need to understand X before deciding" |
| "That's Legal's job" | Shows silo thinking | "I'd partner with Legal on that" |
| Blaming previous employers | Shows lack of professionalism | Focus on what you learned |
| No questions for the interviewer | Shows lack of engagement | Always have 2-3 thoughtful questions |

- "What happened to the last person in this role?"
- "What's the team structure?"

## Case Study Practice

Work through these scenarios. Write out your thought process.

### Case 1: The Urgent Vendor

**Scenario:** Sales closed a deal Friday. The vendor needs access to customer data Monday. No security review has been done.

**Consider:**
- What's the actual risk?
- What's the minimum viable review?
- What conditions would you put on proceeding?
- How do you document this decision?

---

### Case 2: The Gray Area

**Scenario:** Marketing wants to use customer purchase data to recommend similar products. Legal says it's fine. A customer complains it feels "creepy."

**Consider:**
- Is "legal" the same as "right"?
- What's the reputational risk?
- How do you balance customer trust with business goals?
- What would you recommend?

---

### Case 3: The Escalation

**Scenario:** You discover a process that's been non-compliant for 6 months. Your manager says to fix it quietly and not escalate.

**Consider:**
- What are the risks of not escalating?
- How do you push back professionally?
- What would you document?
- At what point would you escalate over your manager?

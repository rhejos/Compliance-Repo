## Alert 1: Earnings Call Preparation

**Disposition:** **NO ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

**Rationale:**
This is appropriate handling of material non-public information by authorized personnel. Key points:
- CFO and IR are exactly the people who should be preparing earnings announcements
- "Don't tell anyone" is appropriate pre-announcement confidentiality
- The announcement timing (after market close) is proper procedure
- Both parties are clearly on the "need to know" list

This represents the control working properly, not a violation.

**Documentation:**
"CFO and IR Director preparing earnings call materials. Discussion of non-public announcement (buyback authorization) is appropriate for their roles. Pre-announcement confidentiality instructions are proper procedure. No concern - authorized personnel handling MNPI correctly."

**Escalation:** None required

## Alert 2: Employee Looking for New Job

**Disposition:** **MONITOR / ESCALATE TO HR**

**Rationale:**
Multiple concerns here:
1. **Competitor contact:** Sales Director communicating with someone at a competitor
2. **Job search on company time:** Using work email for job search activities
3. **Potential data risk:** Employee preparing to leave may pose data exfiltration risk
4. **Not a surveillance violation:** Personal job searches aren't regulatory issues

This isn't a trading or market conduct issue, but it's HR-relevant.

**Documentation:**
"Sales Director appears to be pursuing employment opportunity at competitor. Used work email to coordinate personal email resume submission. Not a trading/regulatory concern. Flagging to HR for awareness of potential departure and associated access review considerations."

**Escalation:** HR notification for employee departure awareness and access monitoring

## Alert 3: External Trading Discussion

**Disposition:** **NO ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

**Rationale:**
This is a routine trading conversation with no concerning elements:
- External contact is sharing their own views (not receiving inside info)
- "Loading up before" refers to their own trading thesis, not MNPI
- Chris explicitly disclaims any inside information ("No inside info, just technicals")
- David notes his firm is restricted on AMD (proper awareness of restrictions)
- This is normal market color discussion

**Documentation:**
"Trader discussion with external contact about market views. External party's 'load up before earnings' is their own investment thesis, explicitly stated as technical analysis, not inside information. Our trader properly noted research restriction on AMD. Normal market discussion, no concern."

**Escalation:** None required

## Alert 4: Bribery/FCPA Concern

**Disposition:** **IMMEDIATE ESCALATION**

**Rationale:**
This is a textbook FCPA (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) red flag:
- Explicit mention of payment to government official
- Purpose: expedite permits (quid pro quo)
- Through intermediary (local partner) - classic structure to distance
- "Just how business is done" - common rationalization for bribery

Critically important: The employee did the right thing by not agreeing and flagging internally. This is the control working. Still requires immediate escalation.

**Documentation:**
"Employee received request from local partner to facilitate $50K payment to Indonesian government official for permit expedition. Employee properly declined to proceed and flagged internally. Classic FCPA red flag. Employee conduct appears appropriate but requires immediate Legal/Compliance review of partner relationship and any prior payments."

**Escalation:** IMMEDIATE to Legal/Compliance/CCO
- FCPA implications
- Partner relationship review
- Historical payment review
- Possible FCPA declination/disclosure consideration

## Alert 5: Office Space Acquisition

**Disposition:** **FALSE POSITIVE**

**Rationale:**
This is an amusing false positive - "acquisition" refers to acquiring office space (real estate), not a corporate acquisition. There is no MNPI concern:
- Office space is not material information
- This affects no securities
- Normal corporate communication
- The "secret" and "announcement" language is just playful internal communication

**Documentation:**
"False positive. 'Acquisition' refers to office space/real estate, not corporate M&A. Announcement of office expansion is not material non-public information. Routine facilities communication with playful language. No concern."

**Escalation:** None required

---

## Alert 6: Personal Trading Policy Question

**Disposition:** **NO ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

**Rationale:**
This is exactly the behavior we want to see:
- Employee proactively asking compliance about potential conflict
- Following proper channels
- Getting correct guidance
- Committing to appropriate conduct

This is the personal trading policy working as intended.

**Documentation:**
"Research analyst proactively consulting Compliance about family member trading. Compliance provided appropriate guidance - no issue where no household/financial connection. Employee demonstrated proper compliance awareness. Positive indicator of policy effectiveness."

**Escalation:** None required

---

## Alert 7: Deal Termination

**Disposition:** **FALSE POSITIVE**

**Rationale:**
"Kill the deal" is common M&A terminology meaning to terminate/abandon a transaction. Context makes this clear:
- This is an M&A team discussing a project termination
- Following proper deal wind-down procedures
- The decision is based on due diligence findings (accounting irregularities)
- No concerning language about trading or tipping

**Documentation:**
"False positive on 'kill' + 'deal'. Standard M&A terminology for terminating a transaction. M&A team properly winding down abandoned project (Project Atlas). Decision based on due diligence findings. Normal business communication."

**Escalation:** None required

---

## Alert 8: Press Inquiry

**Disposition:** **IMMEDIATE ESCALATION**

**Rationale:**
This requires immediate escalation for multiple reasons:
1. **Media inquiry:** Requires coordinated response through proper channels
2. **Allegation of impropriety:** Reporter suggesting insider trading in equity grants
3. **Tight timeline:** 3pm deadline requires urgent attention
4. **Potential litigation/SEC exposure:** Public allegations can trigger regulatory interest

This is not about whether the allegation is true - it's about proper handling.

**Documentation:**
"Press inquiry from Financial News alleging potential insider trading in CEO equity grants. Reporter requesting comment by 3pm today. Requires immediate escalation to Legal/Communications for coordinated response. Note: This is escalation for proper media handling, not a determination on underlying allegations."

**Escalation:** IMMEDIATE to Legal, Communications, and CCO
- Media inquiry handling
- Assessment of allegation
- Potential for regulatory interest
- Response preparation

## Alert 9: Offshore Wire Transfer

**Disposition:** **MONITOR / VERIFY**

**Rationale:**
This needs context before clearing:
- Offshore payments can be legitimate (law firms, consultants)
- "Recurring for 2 years" suggests established relationship
- But Cayman Islands + "offshore" warrants verification
- Need to confirm vendor is legitimate and payment is proper

Not necessarily concerning, but warrants verification before clearing.

**Documentation:**
"Offshore wire transfer to Cayman Islands for legal services. AP indicates recurring payment for 2 years. While potentially legitimate, offshore payments warrant verification. Recommend confirming: (1) vendor on approved vendor list, (2) engagement letter on file, (3) payment matches contracted amounts. Clear after verification."

**Escalation:** Request verification from AP/Treasury
- Not a full escalation but verification before clearing
- If any irregularities found, escalate to Finance/Compliance

---

## Alert 10: Frustrated Engineering Discussion

**Disposition:** **NO ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

**Rationale:**
This is workplace frustration about a policy change, not a conduct issue:
- Employees expressing disagreement with new process
- Language is frustrated but not threatening or harassing
- Manager (Sam_Lead) is appropriately de-escalating
- Moving conversation to private channel is appropriate
- No protected class references, no threats

While the sentiment analysis flagged "hostile language," this is normal workplace disagreement.

**Documentation:**
"Engineering team expressing frustration about new code review policy. Language is frustrated but not threatening or harassing. No protected class references or concerning conduct. Manager appropriately de-escalating and moving to private discussion. Normal workplace disagreement about process change. No action required."

**Escalation:** None required
- Note: If pattern of concerning communications from individuals emerges, may warrant HR awareness
